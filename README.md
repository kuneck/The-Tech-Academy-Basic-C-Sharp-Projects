# The Tech Academy Basic C-Sharp Projects

Welcome to the repository for my coding projects from The Tech Academy Basic C-Sharp course! This repository it will contains a collection of C# projects that I have completed as part of my coursework, follow the list of largers one:

Twenty One - A Functional Blackjack Game
Summary:
The Twenty One project is a complete and functional implementation of the classic card game Blackjack. This console-based application allows players to play against the computer dealer, following the traditional rules of Blackjack. The game includes features such as dealing cards, calculating hand values, handling aces as 1 or 11, and determining the winner based on the closest hand value to 21 without exceeding it. This project demonstrates proficiency in C# programming, object-oriented design, and game logic implementation.

Features:

Interactive gameplay against the computer dealer.
Accurate handling of Blackjack rules and scoring.
User-friendly console interface for a seamless gaming experience.

Car Insurance - Premium Calculation Program
Summary:
The Car Insurance project is a comprehensive program designed to calculate car insurance premiums based on a variety of factors. This application evaluates criteria such as the driver's age, car model, manufacturing year, and other relevant details to determine the insurance cost. By implementing this project, a robust understanding of C# and algorithmic logic was demonstrated, along with an ability to create real-world applications that utilize complex conditional statements and user input handling.

Features:

Detailed insurance premium calculation based on multiple factors.
Input validation to ensure accurate data processing.
Clear and concise output of the calculated insurance premium.

Happy coding!
